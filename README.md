# Footwear-Predictive-Model

The code in this repository was written to build models with the goal of predicting runner satisfaction from footwear mechanical properties.  These models have been submitted as a research paper to the Footwear Science journal.  Since it is an R markdown file, the steps are written out within the code itself.
